# Real-time chat with Expo Go and React Native
## Session 1 - Introductions

### What is React Native?
A brief explanation: 
https://reactnative.dev

Examples of apps that use this technology: 
https://reactnative.dev/showcase

Helps you build applications that can be used by people on pretty much anything that has a screen. Why limit what you are building to only being accessible in a web browser?

React Native leverages the React JavaScript library at its core.

### What is Expo Go?
https://expo.dev/

Expo Go makes it easier to build, test, and deploy React Native applications.  

### What is already setup for you
