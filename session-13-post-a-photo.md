# Real-time chat with Expo Go and React Native
## Session 12 - Post a photo

#### Note: This is a longer session than most.  It would be a good idea to take a break before starting this material.

In this session we will be adding a feature to post photos in our chat application.  To do this we will need to do the following.
1. Add a photo button on the chat screen so that users can use this feature.
2. Add a new route and screen where the photo will be taken.
3. Add the ability to use the camera on this new screen.
